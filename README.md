## Code Kentucky

Hello! My name is **Derek Noe**. I am 41 years old and have been trying to learn as much as I can about coding. I have some experience using Python, mainly for data science📊 purposes. I enjoy practing on *Juypter Notebook*, or *Google Colab*. I recently completed a few lessons on Codecademy using C#, and have took a couple Udemy courses. I am looking forward to learning all I can through **Code Kentucky** and hope to land a job using these skills.🌝
